# README

This repository contains two primary projects developed in Matlab/Simulink, focusing on drone and radar modeling.

## 1. Drone Modeling in Matlab/Simulink

In this project, I modeled a drone using Matlab/Simulink based on real-world specifications obtained from various documents detailing the characteristics and performance metrics of drones. 
The model aims to simulate the drone's behavior in different flight conditions and includes aspects like control systems and dynamic response.

## 2. Radar Characteristic Modeling

This project involves the modeling of various radar characteristics. 
The focus is on simulating key radar properties, including signal processing, target detection, and radar cross-section (RCS) analysis. 
This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how radar systems operate under different conditions.
